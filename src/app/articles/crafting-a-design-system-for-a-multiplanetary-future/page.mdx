After scoring 726 on my first attempt—just shy of the 750 required—I realized the AWS DevOps Professional exam demanded more than familiarity with AWS services. It tested whether I could evaluate competing solutions under pressure, apply architectural thinking, and navigate multi-service scenarios with confidence.

## The Real Problem: I Was Thinking Like a Developer, Not an Architect

When I saw **726** flash on my screen after my first AWS DevOps Professional exam attempt (passing score: 750), I felt the sting of being so close yet falling short. Working at AWS, I had hands-on experience with the services. I could deploy infrastructure, configure pipelines, troubleshoot production issues.

But the exam exposed a critical gap: **I knew what services did, but not how to think like an AWS DevOps architect making decisions under constraints.**

The exam doesn't ask "What does CodeDeploy do?" It asks:

> _"You have a 3-tier application with a database that can't have downtime, a frontend that needs A/B testing capability, and a compliance requirement for audit trails. Traffic must shift gradually with automated rollback. Which deployment strategy optimally addresses ALL requirements?"_

That's when I realized: this isn't a knowledge test—it's a **decision-making simulation**.

## What Didn't Work (First Attempt)

### Surface-Level Service Knowledge

I knew what services did, but not the nuanced differences between similar solutions. Understanding when to use **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** versus **AWS Secrets Manager** isn't about features—it's about understanding rotation requirements, versioning needs, and cost implications in context.

      className="h-auto w-full"
    />
  </div>

### Rushing Through Practice Questions

I'd focus on my score rather than understanding _why_ incorrect answers were wrong. This left knowledge gaps that the real exam expertly exposed.

### Ignoring the "AWS Way"

I approached problems with a general DevOps mindset rather than understanding AWS's preferred architectural patterns and Well-Architected principles.

Seeing a 726 pop onto the screen was humbling. It wasn’t a lack of experience—working with AWS daily gave me plenty of hands-on exposure—but the exam evaluates how you think, not what you’ve memorized.

The exam rewards individuals who can interpret architectural constraints, evaluate trade-offs, and select the “most appropriate” solution among several technically correct options. My first attempt made it clear: I was thinking like a developer, not a DevOps architect.
